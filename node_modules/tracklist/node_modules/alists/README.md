# alists

This tiny, tiny module is for converting between lists of key-value pairs, such as

    [['a', 1], ['b', 2]]

and "equivalent" objects, such as

    { 'a': 1,
      'b': 2 }

in this case.

Such key-valued pairs are being referred to, in this case, as "alists" after
the lisp construct

    ( ('a' . 1) ('b' . 2) )

which, while obviously utilizing cons cells and linked lists, is similar enough
for my purposes to be called the same thing.

One purpose for such a thing may be to build objects out
of zipped key/val pairs.

# Methods:

As you can see, there aren't very many:

## toObj :

    > alists.toObj([ ['a', 1], ['b', 2] ])
    { a: 1, b: 2 }

## toList :

    > alists.toList({'a': 1, 'b': 2})
    [ [ 'a', 1 ],
      [ 'b', 2 ] ]
